In my solution, I employed the LLM Chatbot tools in the following ways:

1. I used jq to extract specific fields from the JSON objects (id, title, total_books_count), calculate the total books count, and format the output.
2. After extracting and formatting the data, I used the sort command to order the series by the total books count in descending order, then used the head command to get the top 5 series.
3. Finally, I used the column command to neatly format the output into a table.

Validating Its Correctness:

1. Verified the output with the expected result.
2. Took a few series from the output and manually calculated their total book count from the original JSON file.
